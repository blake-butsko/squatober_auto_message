Squatober is a series of squat workouts that get posted by [Pen and Paper Strength](https://www.instagram.com/penandpaperstrengthapp) over the length of October 🏋️‍♂️🎃🎃  
I hurt my hip leading up to the month, so I was unable to do the load bearing excercises  
So to combat bordem, do some rehab, and still do squatober some of my friends and I are going squats equal to the summation of each day  
Ex. 1st: 1, 2nd: 3 (2+1), 3rd: 6 (3+2+1), 4th: 10, 5th: 15, ..., 31st: 496  
This is a automated message that tells you the number of squats to do each day  

This is my first time hosting a script (I used github actions) it's really cool  
If you also wanna recieve texts then send me a dm with your number and service provider, or if you don't feel comfortable with that I wrote some extra code to use your email
